FIXME:
Move code that allocates new page tables from page fault handler to function page_map
-video-text:
select video mode
fix show,hide cursor
count rows and columns (not hard-wired to 80x25)
test for monochrome monitor
-disk:
disk driver is very poor!
fat driver is very poor!
-paging
Paging
Swapping
Protecting pages
-kmalloc
merge free blocks
-GTD - URGENT!
The GDT is temporary from the boot loader. Replace it! Also add tss entry?

TODO:
Implement kmemcpy and use it in read_file
Use APIC instead of PIC
Use DMA for HD driver (+ fix alot of other things for HD)
Design a driver system
Start in 24bit color, 1024x768, show loading screen
better keyboard io
processes
handle all exceptions
load drivers
page swapping
task switching
process sceduling
loading, linking elfs
system calls
VM8086 Processes
support fat12, fat16, fat32
file systems (load extras from drivers)
Video driver
GUI
mouse input
API (Application Programming Interface)
User disk drivers
...

NOTES:
- Only one page table is given in the loader for the kernel, so keep it < 4MB.
- The gdt is located in the boot loader, so don't overrwrite it before we load a new one.
- The FAT initialization reads the boot sector at 0x7C00, so don't overwrite it before 
  the initialization.
