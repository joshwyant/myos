Today is August 2nd 2008. I wanted to save a snapshot of MyOS, so I went ahead
and gathered all of the MyOS folders scattered on my hard drive and made zips
for them, too. It brings together a little history. The 2-29-08 snapshot is
close to the beginning stage. I stopped on MyOS for a long time after the 5-2-08
snapshot because on 5-3-08 I started working on vgui. I stopped for a long time,
but when I got back from my dad's I finished Vgui, made my Spanish verb program,
and started working on MyOS again.

And, today is July 21st, 2015, 7 years later.

On November 12th, 2011, I had made a previous attempt to migrate these "snapshot" folders to mercurial. 
I got to June 6th (this commit). All previous commit messages will reflect those. Now I'm finishing the
task and migrating the whole thing to Git, once and for all! And, hopefully with the correct dates.
