Today is August 2nd 2008. I wanted to save a snapshot of MyOS, so I went ahead
and gathered all of the MyOS folders scattered on my hard drive and made zips
for them, too. It brings together a little history. The 2-29-08 snapshot is
close to the beginning stage. I stopped on MyOS for a long time after the 5-2-08
snapshot because on 5-3-08 I started working on vgui. I stopped for a long time,
but when I got back from my dad's I finished Vgui, made my Spanish verb program,
and started working on MyOS again.
